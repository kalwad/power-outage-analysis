# Power Outage Cause Prediction (2000–2016)

This project analyzes major power outages in the U.S. from 2000 to 2016 using a dataset from [Purdue LASCI](https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages). It uses machine learning to predict **cause** of each outage using features that were available to me at the **start** of the outage.

---

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict cause of major power outages using data in real time
- **Type:** Multiclass classification using Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifier
- **Tools:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Plotly, GitHub Pages

---

## Key Findings

| Model                 | Accuracy | Notes |
|----------------------|----------|-------|
| Logistic Regression  | ~82%     | High accuracy, poor recall on minority classes |
| Random Forest (tuned)| ~85%     | Strong F1 for dominant causes: *severe weather* and *intentional attack* |

**Engineered Features:**
- `DEMAND_LOSS_PER_CUSTOMER`
- `IS_HURRICANE`
